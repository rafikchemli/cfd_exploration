Figure 1: Distribution of particle states in the CFD simulation. The dataset contains 11000 particles distributed across 3 states (penetrating, bouncing, oscillating).

Figure 2: Correlation heatmap between particle features and states. Positive values (red) indicate positive correlation, while negative values (blue) indicate inverse correlation.

Figure 3: Proportion of particle states within each of the 8 clusters. The stacked bar chart shows how particles with different states (bouncing, oscillating, penetrating) are distributed across the 8 identified clusters.

Figure 4: UMAP dimensionality reduction visualization of the particle feature space. Points are colored by particle state.

Figure 5: Standardized feature values by particle state. Bars show the mean value for each feature across states.

Figure 6: Feature patterns across the 8 clusters. The heatmap shows the standardized mean values for each feature.

Figure 7: Parallel coordinates plot of standardized feature values by state.
